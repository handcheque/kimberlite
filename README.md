# Project Kimberlite

An auditable immutable datastore with extreme write performance

## What is it?

Kimberlite is a thin application wrapper in front of a Cassandra database 
that turns Cassandra into an append-only database with an HMAC-based data 
consistency mechanism and optional Blockchain notary functionality.
